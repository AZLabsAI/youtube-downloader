## 🔧 Code Changes

### Modified: `services/ytdlp.service.ts`

**Added cookie authentication support:**

```typescript
// New properties
private cookiesFile: string = '/tmp/yt-cookies.txt';
private cookiesInitialized: boolean = false;

// New methods
- initializeCookies(): Loads cookies from YTDLP_COOKIES env var
- getBaseArgs(): Adds --cookies flag when cookies are available

// Modified methods
- getVideoMetadata(): Now uses cookies for authentication
- downloadVideoWithQuality(): Now includes cookies in all downloads
```

**What this solves:**
- ✅ Age-restricted videos now downloadable
- ✅ Bot detection bypassed
- ✅ Region-locked content accessible
- ✅ Better success rate for all videos

---

### Added: `.env.example`

Template for environment variables:
```bash
# YouTube Cookies (Base64 Encoded)
YTDLP_COOKIES=

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

---

### Updated: `.gitignore`

**Added cookie protection:**
```gitignore
# cookies and authentication
*.cookies
*cookies.txt
youtube-cookies*
cookies.b64
*.b64
```

**Critical for security:** Prevents accidental commit of sensitive authentication data.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - Implementing Cookie Support

### 1. Extract Cookies from Browser

**Chrome/Edge:**
- Install "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" extension
- Sign in to YouTube
- Export cookies as Netscape format

**Firefox:**
- Install "cookies.txt" extension
- Sign in to YouTube
- Export cookies

### 2. Prepare for Production

```bash
# Base64 encode the cookies
base64 youtube-cookies.txt > youtube-cookies.b64

# Copy the output
cat youtube-cookies.b64
```

### 3. Set Environment Variable

**Development:**
```bash
# Create .env.local
echo "YTDLP_COOKIES=$(cat youtube-cookies.b64)" > .env.local
```

**Production (Docker):**
```bash
# Set in platform (Render, Railway, etc.)
YTDLP_COOKIES=<paste base64 encoded cookies>
```

### 4. Deploy

The code is already implemented! Just:
1. Set the environment variable
2. Deploy/restart your application
3. Test with age-restricted videos

---

## 📊 What This Solves

### Before (Without Cookies):
- ❌ Age-restricted videos fail with "Sign in required"
- ❌ Some videos show "Video unavailable"
- ❌ Bot detection blocks downloads
- ❌ Missing premium quality streams

### After (With Cookies):
- ✅ Age-restricted videos download successfully
- ✅ All public videos accessible
- ✅ Bot detection bypassed
- ✅ Access to highest quality streams
- ✅ Better overall success rate

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ⚠️ Important Warnings:

1. **Never commit cookies to version control**
   - Already protected in `.gitignore`
   - Use environment variables only

2. **Cookies contain sensitive data**
   - They grant access to your Google account
   - Can be used to impersonate you
   - Should be encrypted at rest

3. **Cookies expire regularly**
   - Typically valid for 2 weeks to 6 months
   - Set up refresh reminders
   - Monitor for authentication failures

4. **Terms of Service**
   - Using automation may violate YouTube ToS
   - Intended for personal/educational use only
   - Not for commercial services

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I need cookies to use the app?**
A: No, but some videos (age-restricted, region-locked) will fail without them.

**Q: Are cookies safe to use?**
A: They're as safe as your Google account. Keep them secure, never commit to git.

**Q: How often do I need to refresh cookies?**
A: Typically every 2-4 weeks. Monitor for failures and refresh as needed.

**Q: Can I use someone else's cookies?**
A: Technically yes, but this is a security/privacy violation. Use your own.

**Q: What if cookies stop working?**
A: Export new cookies from your browser and update the environment variable.
